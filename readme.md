# A simple solver of isotropic 0d-Boltzman's equation

Two limiting models are implemented.

+ Linear model. The test particles collide only with the thermal particles with different mass. This particles are heated to some very high energy with given rate.
+ Nonlinear model. The test particles collide only with the same-kind particles. The particules are heated to some very high energy with given rate, and at the same time gradually cooled down according to another rate.
